# Security Review — Branch / PR Diff Only

## Determine Review Scope

1. **Identify Aspects**: Parse "$ARGUMENTS" to identify specific security `aspects` (e.g., `auth`, `injection`, `data-leakage`, `supply-chain`) or `all`.
2. **Identify Target & Base**:
    - If the user provided branch names (e.g., `feature/auth main`), use them.
    - Otherwise, you **MUST** execute the `.specify/scripts/bash/detect-changed-files.sh` with `--json` to detect changed files between the feature branch and the default branch (`Mode A`).
    - Use the `changed_files` list as the primary audit set.

## Objective

Review **only the code changes introduced in the identified scope**. Do not review unchanged code in the full codebase. Produce targeted security findings with severity, location, and remediation guidance.
If `flash-mem` is available, use `flash-mem prepare-context` and the canonical memory tools (`get_project_summary`, `search_memory`, `get_relevant_context`). If `flash-mem` is not installed, fall back to the MCP tools exposed by `spec-kit-memory-hub`; do not shell out to `npx memory-hub` directly.

## Flash-Mem Security Context Retrieval

Before performing security analysis:

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant security context before reading the diff in depth.
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval and collect `title`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `confidence`, and `related files` first.
3. Prioritize retrieval in this order: project-specific security memories, recent findings, high-confidence findings, previously validated findings, repeated attack patterns, and organization-wide lessons learned.
4. Retrieve full memory content only when summaries are insufficient, a finding appears highly relevant, or detailed remediation history is required.
5. Check whether a candidate finding has previously occurred, been accepted as risk, been mitigated, or been classified as a false positive.
6. Reuse validated security knowledge whenever possible and avoid generating duplicate findings when historical evidence already exists.
7. Keep the workflow compatible with future Flash-Mem improvements and do not depend on storage internals, ranking details, or export behavior.

## Flash-Mem Security Knowledge Capture

After analysis completes, store durable security knowledge back into Flash-Mem.

Persist:

- confirmed vulnerabilities
- approved mitigations
- accepted risks
- recurring attack patterns
- authentication decisions
- authorization decisions
- secure-by-design decisions
- compliance-related decisions
- remediation lessons learned
- validated false-positive patterns

Do not persist:

- speculative findings
- temporary reasoning
- incomplete investigations
- low-confidence assumptions
- intermediate analysis artifacts

## Security Memory Quality Rules

Before storing security memory, verify that evidence exists, the finding is actionable, the memory will be reusable, the result is validated, and confidence is sufficient.
Prefer fewer high-quality security memories over many low-value memories.

## Security Retrieval Priorities

When multiple memories exist, prioritize:

1. Project-specific security memories
2. Recent security findings
3. High-confidence findings
4. Previously validated findings
5. Repeated attack patterns
6. Organization-wide lessons learned

Avoid retrieving redundant memories.

This command is the right fit for a branch, pull request, or merge request diff.

## Steps

1. **Identify Scope**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/detect-changed-files.sh` or use user-provided branch names to identify the changed files. If using branches, determine `<base>` and `<target>`.
2. **Retrieve Diff**: Run `git diff <base>..<target>` (or run `git diff` restricted to the identified changed files) to retrieve the actual code changes.
3. **Analyze Diff**: Analyze only the diff for security issues across these domains (focusing on requested aspects):
    - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, NoSQL, command, template)
    - Hardcoded secrets or credentials
    - Compliance with the Spec-Kit memory hub context.
    - If Flash-Mem shows a candidate issue was previously accepted, mitigated, or classified as a false positive, do not emit a duplicate finding; classify it as already covered instead.

        #### Optimizer-Aware Flow

        When `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml` has `optimizer.enabled: true` and the CLI is available:

        1. **Prepare Context**: Execute `flash-mem prepare-context --feature specs/<feature> --query "security constraints vulnerabilities authentication authorization data-leakage"`.
        2. **Read Synthesis**: Read `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` (or the search results) first.

        #### Markdown-Only Flow

        When the optimizer is disabled or unavailable, you **MUST** read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`:

        - `docs/memory/INDEX.md`
        - `docs/memory/`
        - `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`
        - `specs/<feature>/memory.md`
        - `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md`
        - `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md`
        - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

    - Broken access control or missing authorization checks
    - Cryptographic failures (weak algorithms, hardcoded keys)
    - Security misconfiguration
    - Input validation gaps
    - Authentication or session weaknesses
    - Insecure data handling
    - Vulnerable or newly added dependencies
    - Supply chain risks in newly added packages

4. **Report Findings**: For each finding, report severity, location, OWASP category, description, remediation, and Spec-Kit task.
5. **Action Plan**: Provide a prioritized action plan for fixing findings.
6. **Durable Memory Preservation (Mandatory Check)**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, you **MUST** use `flash-mem capture_artifact_memory` after providing the report. If `flash-mem` is unavailable, fall back to the corresponding `spec-kit-memory-hub` capture flow and wait for user approval.

## Document Header

Before writing the report body, emit a YAML frontmatter block at the very start of the output document. Populate all values from your analysis. Copy the `field_summaries` section verbatim — it is static schema documentation that enables any LLM or indexer reading only the header to understand the full field schema without parsing the report body.

```yaml

owasp_categories: [<A01>, <A05>, ...]
cwe_ids: [<CWE-89>, ...]
field_summaries:

  cwe_ids: "CWE identifiers referenced in this document."
  finding_id: "Unique finding identifier (SEC-NNN) for cross-referencing and task linkage."
  location: "File path and line number of the vulnerable code (path/to/file.ext:line)."
  owasp_category: "OWASP Top 10 2025 category for this finding (AXX:2025-Name)."
  cwe: "Common Weakness Enumeration identifier with short name (CWE-NNN: Name)."
  cvss_score: "CVSS v3.1 base score (0.0-10.0). 9.0+=Critical, 7.0-8.9=High, 4.0-6.9=Medium, 0.1-3.9=Low."

## Memory Hub INDEX.md Row

After the report, output the following proposed routing row for the user to paste into their `docs/memory/INDEX.md`. This enables LLM-based filtering without loading the full document.

```text
| <relative path where this doc is saved> | branch | <assessment_date> | <overall_risk> | C:<critical_count> H:<high_count> M:<medium_count> L:<low_count> | <owasp_categories comma-separated> |
```

Example:

```text
| docs/security-reviews/2026-05-07-feature-auth.md | branch | 2026-05-07 | HIGH | C:1 H:2 M:1 L:0 | A05,A07 |
```

See `docs/field-registry.md` in the security-review-extension for the full INDEX.md table format and SQLite Phase 1 column mapping.
