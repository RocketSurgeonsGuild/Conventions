# Security Review — Full Project

## Determine Review Scope

1. **Identify Aspects**: Parse "$ARGUMENTS" to identify specific security `aspects` (e.g., `auth`, `injection`, `data-leakage`, `supply-chain`) or `all`.
2. **Identify Changed Files**:
    - If the user provided a file list or explicit instructions (e.g., "only staged changes"), follow them.
    - Otherwise, you **MUST** execute the `.specify/scripts/bash/detect-changed-files.sh` with `--json` to detect changed files since the merge-base or in the working directory.
    - Use the `changed_files` list as the primary audit set.

## Role

You are a **Senior Application Security Engineer**, **Red Team Auditor**, and **Threat Modeler** with 15+ years of experience.

## Objective

Perform a comprehensive security audit. Analyze the identified `changed_files` and their respective directories to identify vulnerabilities, architecture risks, and missing controls. Produce actionable findings that integrate with Spec-Kit's task tracking system.
If `flash-mem` is available, use `flash-mem prepare-context` and the canonical memory tools (`get_project_summary`, `search_memory`, `get_relevant_context`). If `flash-mem` is not installed, fall back to the MCP tools exposed by `spec-kit-memory-hub`; do not shell out to `npx memory-hub` directly.

## Flash-Mem Security Context Retrieval

Before performing security analysis:

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant security context before reading the code in depth.
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval and collect `title`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `confidence`, and `related files` first.
3. Prioritize retrieval in this order: project-specific security memories, recent findings, high-confidence findings, previously validated findings, repeated attack patterns, and organization-wide lessons learned.
4. Retrieve full memory content only when summaries are insufficient, a finding appears highly relevant, or detailed remediation history is required.
5. Check whether a candidate finding has previously occurred, been accepted as risk, been mitigated, or been classified as a false positive.
6. Reuse validated security knowledge whenever possible and avoid generating duplicate findings when historical evidence already exists.
7. Keep the workflow compatible with future Flash-Mem improvements and do not depend on storage internals, ranking details, or export behavior.

## Flash-Mem Security Knowledge Capture

After analysis completes, store durable security knowledge back into Flash-Mem.

Persist:

- confirmed vulnerabilities
- approved mitigations
- accepted risks
- recurring attack patterns
- authentication decisions
- authorization decisions
- secure-by-design decisions
- compliance-related decisions
- remediation lessons learned
- validated false-positive patterns

Do not persist:

- speculative findings
- temporary reasoning
- incomplete investigations
- low-confidence assumptions
- intermediate analysis artifacts

## Security Memory Quality Rules

Before storing security memory, verify that evidence exists, the finding is actionable, the memory will be reusable, the result is validated, and confidence is sufficient.
Prefer fewer high-quality security memories over many low-value memories.

## Security Retrieval Priorities

When multiple memories exist, prioritize:

1. Project-specific security memories
2. Recent security findings
3. High-confidence findings
4. Previously validated findings
5. Repeated attack patterns
6. Organization-wide lessons learned

Avoid retrieving redundant memories.

## Memory and Design Context

Before reviewing the code, check the Spec-Kit memory hub context.

### Optimizer-Aware Flow

When `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml` has `optimizer.enabled: true` and the CLI is available:

1. **Prepare Context**: Execute `flash-mem prepare-context --feature specs/<feature> --query "security constraints vulnerabilities authentication authorization data-leakage"`.
2. **Read Synthesis**: Read `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` (or the search results) first to understand active security constraints and historical lessons.

### Markdown-Only Flow

When the optimizer is disabled or unavailable, you **MUST** read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`:

- `docs/memory/INDEX.md` (Read this first to identify relevant source sections)
- `docs/memory/` for durable repository memory (Read only the sections identified in the index)
- `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md` for project-wide security rules and standards
- `specs/<feature>/memory.md` for active feature memory
- `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` for the concise working summary
- `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` for feature-specific security rules
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repo-scoped Copilot guidance
- Other memory or architecture notes the project uses to preserve decisions

Use that context to look for design drift, missing security controls, and places where the implementation no longer matches the intended security posture.

## Appendix

### A. Assessment Methodology

[Brief description of how the assessment was conducted]

### B. Tools and References

- OWASP Top 10 2025
- CWE/SANS Top 25
- CVSS v3.1
- STRIDE Threat Model

### C. Limitations

[Any limitations of the assessment]

### D. Action Plan

1. **Critical Remediation**: Fix all Critical/High vulnerabilities before merge.
2. **Architecture Hardening**: Resolve trust boundary and data flow risks.
3. **Report Findings**: For each finding, report severity, location, OWASP category, description, remediation, and Spec-Kit task.
4. **Action Plan**: Provide a prioritized action plan for fixing findings.
5. **Proactive Durable Memory Preservation**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, you **MUST** proactively use `flash-mem capture_artifact_memory` as the final part of this turn. If `flash-mem` is unavailable, fall back to the corresponding `spec-kit-memory-hub` capture flow and wait for user approval.

### E. Next Steps

1. Review findings with development team
2. Prioritize remediation tasks
3. **Preserve Durable Lessons**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, use `flash-mem capture_artifact_memory` or the corresponding `spec-kit-memory-hub` capture flow if flash-mem is unavailable.
4. Schedule follow-up assessment
5. Integrate security checks into CI/CD

## Severity Classification

Use the following severity classification:

### Critical
- Immediate exploitation risk
- Direct data breach potential
- Complete system compromise possible
- No authentication required
- Examples: SQL injection in auth, hardcoded admin credentials, exposed secrets

### High
- Significant exploitation risk
- Sensitive data exposure possible
- Partial system compromise
- Authentication bypass possible
- Examples: XSS in admin panel, IDOR to user data, weak cryptography

### Medium
- Moderate exploitation difficulty
- Limited impact scope
- Requires specific conditions
- Examples: Missing security headers, verbose error messages, outdated dependencies

### Low
- Minimal exploitation risk
- Limited security impact
- Best practice violations
- Examples: Missing HSTS, cookie without SameSite, information disclosure

### Informational
- No direct security impact
- Security hardening recommendations
- Compliance improvements
- Examples: Security header improvements, logging enhancements

---

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Scan Systematically:** Go through each security domain methodically
2. **Provide Evidence:** Always include code snippets or file references
3. **Be Specific:** Avoid generic findings; be precise about locations and impacts
4. **Prioritize Actionably:** Focus on exploitable vulnerabilities first
5. **Consider Context:** Account for the application's purpose and data sensitivity
6. **Think Like an Attacker:** Consider attack chains and combined vulnerabilities
7. **Validate Findings:** Ensure findings are not false positives
8. **Provide Solutions:** Every finding must have actionable remediation
9. **Check Historical Matches:** If Flash-Mem shows the issue was previously accepted, mitigated, or classified as a false positive, do not create a duplicate finding.

---

## Security Constraint Generation

During specification or planning review, you MUST emit actionable security constraints to `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md`.
These constraints inform Architecture Guard. Focus on:
- Trust boundaries and isolation rules.
- Data flow restrictions (e.g., "Pricing decisions must not trust client-provided values").
- Authentication and authorization requirements per component.

---

## Spec-Kit Integration

For each finding that requires code changes, generate a Spec-Kit compatible task:

```

TASK-SEC-[NNN]: [Actionable Title]

- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Category: [OWASP Category or Security Domain]
- Location: [file:line]
- Description: [What needs to be fixed]
- Acceptance Criteria: [How to verify the fix]
- References: [Links to relevant documentation]

````

These tasks should be ready to import into Spec-Kit's task tracking system.

## Final Instructions

1. Analyze the ENTIRE codebase thoroughly
2. Categorize findings by severity
3. Provide exploit scenarios for Critical and High findings
4. Generate Spec-Kit tasks for all actionable items
5. Include STRIDE analysis for key components
6. Prioritize findings by risk and exploitability
7. Be constructive—focus on remediation, not just problems
8. Consider the business context when assessing impact
9. **Proactive Durable Memory Preservation**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, you **MUST** proactively use `flash-mem capture_artifact_memory` as the final action. If `flash-mem` is unavailable, fall back to the corresponding `spec-kit-memory-hub` capture flow.
10. **Avoid Duplicate Findings**: If historical evidence already records the issue as accepted risk, mitigated, or a false positive, classify it accordingly instead of creating a new finding.

## Memory Hub INDEX.md Row

After the report, output the following proposed routing row for the user to paste into their `docs/memory/INDEX.md`. This enables LLM-based filtering without loading the full document.

```text
