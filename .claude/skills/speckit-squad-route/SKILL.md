# Squad Bridge: Route Tasks

Read open tasks from the Speckit task list and assign each to the most
appropriate Squad agent using capability matching or round-robin (configured
in `squad-config.yml`).

This command is also triggered by the `after_tasks` hook.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Verify prerequisites**:
    - `specs/<id>/tasks.md` exists; if not, tell the user to run
      `/speckit.tasks` first and stop.
    - `.squad/` exists; if not, tell the user to run
      `/speckit.squad.init` first and stop.

2. **Load bridge config** from `.specify/extensions/squad/squad-config.yml`
   if it exists, otherwise use extension defaults.

3. **Read open tasks** from `specs/<id>/tasks.md`. Parse each task's title,
   description, and any tags or phase labels.

4. **Load Squad agents** and routing rules from `.squad/` (agents directory
   and `routing.md`). Only consider agents with `status: active`.

5. **Route each task** using the configured `routing_strategy`:

    **`capability-match`** (default):
    - Extract domain keywords from the task title and description
    - Match against agent capabilities using the routing rules in `.squad/routing.md`
    - If multiple agents match, prefer the one with the highest capability level
      for the matched domain
    - If no agent matches, assign to coordinator and flag for manual review

    **`round-robin`**:
    - Assign tasks to active agents in a rotating sequence
    - Track assignment counts to ensure even distribution

6. **Determine model tier** for each task:
    - Tasks involving architecture decisions, complex algorithms, or spec
      interpretation → `full` tier
    - Standard feature implementation → `standard` tier
    - Boilerplate, scaffolding, documentation → `lightweight` tier

7. **Output a routing table**:

    ```
    Task Routing Summary
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Task                                  Agent               Tier
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Design REST API endpoints             backend-engineer    full
    Implement JWT authentication          backend-engineer    standard
    Build login form component            frontend-engineer   standard
    Write unit tests for auth service     qa-engineer         standard
    Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline     devops-engineer     standard
    Add README and API docs               ⚠️ coordinator      lightweight
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    Routed: 5 / 6   Unrouted (needs review): 1
    ```

8. **Update `.squad/routing.md`** with any new routing patterns inferred
   from this task batch that aren't already covered.

9. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--update-tasks`, annotate `specs/<id>/tasks.md`
   with agent assignments as metadata comments (e.g.,
   `<!-- squad:agent=backend-engineer tier=standard -->`).

## Notes

- Unrouted tasks (flagged with ⚠️) mean no active agent has a matching
  capability. Consider running `/speckit.squad.generate` if the spec has
  expanded, or manually add an agent with `squad` commands.
- This command does not start or trigger any Squad sessions — it only
  produces routing assignments. Use `squad` directly to begin work.
