# Audit Memory

You are running a high-integrity audit of the project's durable and feature memory for `memory-hub`.

> **Scope note**: When the optimizer is enabled, `npx speckit-memory audit-memory` validates **SQLite cache integrity** only (stale hashes, orphaned rows, missing files, synthesis word budget). It does not evaluate content quality. Full content-quality checks (stale decisions, contradictions, leakage, noise) are performed by **this AI command only** — they require reading the markdown files and applying the rubric below.

## Goal

Validate the quality, accuracy, and density of memory artifacts (`{memory_root}/*.md` and `{specs_root}/<feature>/memory*.md`). Identify stale, contradictory, or low-signal entries that degrade the project's long-term intelligence.

Audit is intentionally expensive and may read all memory files. Normal synthesis must not; it should use `{memory_root}/INDEX.md` and selected source sections only. **IMPORTANT**: You MUST read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`.
When the optimizer is enabled and available, run `cd .specify/extensions/memory-md && npx speckit-memory audit-memory` to validate the SQLite cache, then fall back to markdown-only audit checks if the cache is unavailable.

## Operating Constraints

- **STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: This command is analytical. Do **not** modify any files.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every finding must cite a specific entry or lack thereof.

## Detection Scope

Check for:

- **Stale/Obsolete**: Decisions or patterns that no longer apply to the current codebase.
- **Contradictions**: Memory entries that conflict with the Constitution or other memory files.
- **Noise/Triviality**: Routine history, speculative notes, or implementation details that lack durable value.
- **Index Integrity**: `{memory_root}/INDEX.md` points to valid source entries and stays compact.
- **Selection Hygiene**: Deprecated or superseded decisions are not selected during synthesis.
- **Leakage**: Feature-specific details that belong in `{specs_root}/` but have leaked into `{memory_root}/`.
- **Synthesis Drift**: `{memory_synthesis_filename}` is out of sync with selected memory.
- **Synthesis Budget**: `{memory_synthesis_filename}` exceeds configured `retrieval.max_synthesis_words`.
- **Formatting Issues**: Entries that are too long, vague, or repetitive.
- **Cache Integrity**: Missing source files, invalid references, orphaned DB rows, duplicate memory entries, and stale hashes in the local SQLite cache.

## Severity Guide

- **CRITICAL**: Contradicts the Constitution, contains dangerous/incorrect security guidance, or is fundamentally stale.
- **HIGH**: Significant duplication, misplaced entries in the wrong layer, or missing synthesis for a complex feature.
- **MEDIUM**: Wordy entries, weak evidence, or minor pattern drift.
- **LOW**: Minor formatting or naming inconsistencies.

## Output Format

# Memory Audit Report

| ID  | File           | Severity | Issue                 | Recommendation               |
| :-- | :------------- | :------- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| M1  | `DECISIONS.md` | CRITICAL | Stale decision on [X] | Remove/Update to reflect [Y] |

### Metrics

- **Memory Quality Score**: [e.g. 85/100]
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: [High / Medium / Low]
- **Stale Entry Rate**: [e.g. 5%]
- **Synthesis Accuracy**: [Verified / Drifted]

### Findings Summary

- **Durable Memory Health**: [Summary of PROJECT_CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, DECISIONS]
- **Feature Memory Health**: [Summary of active specs/ memory]

### Action Plan

1. **Critical Cleanup**: Resolve contradictions and stale decisions immediately.
2. **Refactoring**: Merge duplicates and move leaked feature notes to their respective `specs/`.
3. **Synthesis Refresh**: Update `{memory_synthesis_filename}` to reflect current implementation.
4. **Remediation**: "Would you like me to suggest concrete cleanup edits for the top issues?"

`audit-memory` may be expensive because it validates the entire cache.

## Cleanup Rubric

- **Durable**: Will this be useful in 6 months?
- **Actionable**: Does it inform future decisions or implementation?
- **Non-obvious**: Is it something the AI wouldn't already know from standard framework docs?
- **Evidenced**: Is it backed by a PR, bug, or explicit decision?
- **Correctly Scoped**: Is it in the right file?
    - `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for stable product and domain context.
    - `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system shape and boundaries.
    - `DECISIONS.md` for explicit tradeoffs and chosen direction.
    - `BUGS.md` for recurring failure modes and prevention.
    - `WORKLOG.md` for concise high-value milestone notes.
    - `INDEX.md` for compact routing metadata only.
