# Security Review — Formal Export (Whitebox Pentest Style)

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Objective

Synthesize one or more security review reports, follow-up plans, or finding lists into a formal, professional **Whitebox Security Assessment Report**. This report is designed for both stakeholders (Executive) and developers (Technical).

## Scope

Read and analyze the following artifacts when present:

- **Source Findings**: The latest security review report(s) or findings provided in `$ARGUMENTS`.
- **Durable Context**: `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md` and `docs/memory/`.
- **Implementation Context**: `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and relevant `spec.md` files.

### Optimizer-Aware Flow

When `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml` has `optimizer.enabled: true` and the CLI is available:

1. **Prepare Context**: Execute `flash-mem prepare-context --feature specs/<feature> --query "security decisions architecture constraints remediation"`.
2. **Review Findings**: Ensure the export includes historical security context surfaced by the optimizer.
3. If `flash-mem` is available, use its canonical memory tools and `prepare-context` flow. If it is not installed, use the MCP tools exposed by `spec-kit-memory-hub`; do not call `npx memory-hub` directly.

## Flash-Mem Security Context Retrieval

Before synthesizing the export:

1. Search Flash-Mem for relevant security context before consolidating the input reports in depth.
2. Prefer summary-first retrieval and collect `title`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `confidence`, and `related files` first.
3. Prioritize retrieval in this order: project-specific security memories, recent findings, high-confidence findings, previously validated findings, repeated attack patterns, and organization-wide lessons learned.
4. Retrieve full memory content only when summaries are insufficient, a finding appears highly relevant, or detailed remediation history is required.
5. Check whether a candidate finding has previously occurred, been accepted as risk, been mitigated, or been classified as a false positive.
6. Reuse validated security knowledge whenever possible and avoid generating duplicate findings when historical evidence already exists.
7. Keep the workflow compatible with future Flash-Mem improvements and do not depend on storage internals, ranking details, or export behavior.

## Flash-Mem Security Knowledge Capture

After synthesis completes, store durable security knowledge back into Flash-Mem when the export identifies reusable lessons.

Persist:

- confirmed vulnerabilities
- approved mitigations
- accepted risks
- recurring attack patterns
- authentication decisions
- authorization decisions
- secure-by-design decisions
- compliance-related decisions
- remediation lessons learned
- validated false-positive patterns

Do not persist:

- speculative findings
- temporary reasoning
- incomplete investigations
- low-confidence assumptions
- intermediate analysis artifacts

## Security Memory Quality Rules

Before storing security memory, verify that evidence exists, the finding is actionable, the memory will be reusable, the result is validated, and confidence is sufficient.
Prefer fewer high-quality security memories over many low-value memories.

## Security Retrieval Priorities

When multiple memories exist, prioritize:

1. Project-specific security memories
2. Recent security findings
3. High-confidence findings
4. Previously validated findings
5. Repeated attack patterns
6. Organization-wide lessons learned

Avoid retrieving redundant memories.

## Output Format

Produce a structured Markdown report with the following mandatory sections. Use a professional, authoritative, and objective tone.

# [PROJECT NAME] — WHITEBOX SECURITY ASSESSMENT REPORT

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### 1.1 Assessment Overview

[1 paragraph summary of what was tested, when, and by whom (AI Security Auditor). Explicitly mention this was a Whitebox assessment with full source and memory hub access.]

### 1.2 Risk Posture

**Overall Risk Rating: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MODERATE|LOW]**

| Severity | Count | Primary Categories          |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------------- |
| Critical | X     | [e.g. A05:Injection]        |
| High     | X     | [e.g. A07:Authentication]   |
| Medium   | X     | [e.g. A02:Misconfiguration] |
| Low      | X     | [e.g. A09:Logging]          |

### 1.3 Key Findings & Strategic Impact

[2-3 paragraphs summarizing the most critical risks in business terms. What is the impact on data privacy, customer trust, or system availability? Highlight systemic patterns identified.]

### 1.4 Remediation Roadmap

[High-level summary of the implementation priorities. Which fixes should be fast-tracked? What long-term architectural changes are needed?]

---

## 2. ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

### 2.1 Scope of Work

- **Codebase**: [e.g. src/api, src/auth]
- **Documentation**: Spec-Kit Feature Specs, Implementation Plans, Security Constitution.
- **Historical Memory**: Durable repository memory (Memory Hub).

### 2.2 Testing Approach

This was a **Whitebox Security Assessment**. Unlike a blackbox pentest, the auditor had full access to:

- Source code logic and internal data flows.
- Architectural decision records (ADRs) and design intent.
- Historical bug patterns and security constraints preserved in the memory hub.

The assessment evaluated the codebase against **OWASP Top 10 (2025)**, **CWE/SANS Top 25**, and project-specific security standards.

## 3. TECHNICAL FINDINGS

[For each finding, provide the following detail:]

### [FINDING_ID] — [Finding Title]

**Severity**: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MODERATE|LOW]
**OWASP Category**: AXX:2025-Category
**CWE**: CWE-XXX
**CVSS v3.1**: X.X

#### 3.X.1 Description

[Concise technical description of the vulnerability and why it exists.]

#### 3.X.2 Evidence (Affected Code)

**File**: `path/to/file.ext:line`

```[language]
[Snippet of vulnerable code]
```

#### 3.X.3 Exploit Scenario

[Step-by-step technical walk-through of how an attacker would exploit this in the context of the application.]

#### 3.X.4 Impact

[Technical impact: e.g. Unauthorized access to PII, arbitrary code execution, etc.]

#### 3.X.5 Remediation Guidance

[Specific, actionable steps to resolve the finding.]

**Proposed Fix**:

```[language]
[Snippet of secure implementation]
```

---

## 4. ARCHITECTURAL DRIFT & SYSTEMIC RISKS

[Identify risks that aren't single-line bugs but rather systemic failures or deviations from the Security Constitution / Memory Hub intent.]

- **Pattern A**: [e.g. Inconsistent use of authorization middleware]
- **Pattern B**: [e.g. Implicit trust of internal microservice communication]

---

## 5. APPENDICES

### 5.1 CVSS Scoring Rubric

- **9.0 - 10.0**: Critical
- **7.0 - 8.9**: High
- **4.0 - 6.9**: Medium
- **0.1 - 3.9**: Low

### 5.2 Tooling Context

- **Orchestrator**: Spec-Kit Security Review Extension
- **Memory Optimization**: [SQLite-enabled / Markdown-only]
- **Date of Generation**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Final Instructions

1. **Consolidate**: Combine findings from all provided reports. Avoid duplicate entries.
2. **Categorize**: Group findings by OWASP category in the technical section.
3. **Professionalism**: Use formal language (e.g., "The assessment identified..." instead of "I found...").
4. **Actionable**: Ensure every remediation step is compatible with the Spec-Kit `plan.md` style.
5. **Durable Memory**: If systemic findings are found, suggest using `flash-mem capture_artifact_memory` after the export, or the corresponding `spec-kit-memory-hub` capture flow if flash-mem is unavailable.
