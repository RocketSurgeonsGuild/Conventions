# Check — Superpowers Bridge Diagnostics

> **Type:** Bridge-native command
> **Purpose:** Confirm that this extension can bridge installed superpowers skills without guessing, remote fetches, or hidden fallbacks.

---

## User Context

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Treat any user-provided context as additional install or environment notes, but
do not let it override filesystem reality.

---

## Discovery Rules

Search for installed skills in this exact order:

1. `./.agents/skills/`
2. `~/.agents/skills/`

Workspace wins over global when both contain the same skill.

A skill is considered **available** only if all of the following are true:

- The skill directory exists
- `SKILL.md` exists inside that directory
- `SKILL.md` is readable

Do **not** fetch any remote content.
Do **not** silently fall back to embedded summaries.
Do **not** claim a skill is available unless the file is actually present.

---

## Required Skills

This bridge operates on a **Dual-Layer Fallback Architecture**. Skills are classified into Hard Requirements and Optional Skills based on whether the bridge can run its baseline validation hooks without them. For a detailed mapping of skills to Spec Kit stages and fallback states, refer to the **"Superb" Skill Set Matrix** in the extension [README.md](../README.md#dual-layer-fallback--the-superb-skill-set-matrix).

### Hard Requirements

- `test-driven-development`
- `verification-before-completion`

If either hard requirement is unavailable, the corresponding mandatory hook cannot start, and the bridge is blocked.

### Optional Skills

These skills are not strictly required for the baseline workflow because the bridge provides **Layer 2 local fallbacks** (such as regular expressions, local checklists, or embedded prompts) or treats the corresponding stages as non-blocking.

- `brainstorming`
- `subagent-driven-development`
- `executing-plans`
- `systematic-debugging`
- `receiving-code-review`
- `finishing-a-development-branch`
- `dispatching-parallel-agents`
- `requesting-code-review`
- `code-review`
- `writing-plans`

Optional skills do not block the Spec Kit main flow, but their corresponding
bridge commands or discipline enhancements should be reported as unavailable
until installed.

## Verdict

[READY / PARTIAL / BLOCKED]

## Next Actions

- [Concrete installation or retry advice]
```

---

## Failure Rules

- If both discovery roots are missing, report `BLOCKED`
- If any hard requirement is missing, report `BLOCKED`
- If only optional skills are missing, report `PARTIAL`
- If all hard requirements are installed, the main bridge hooks are `READY`

This command is the canonical first step when a user is unsure whether the
bridge can operate correctly on the current machine.
