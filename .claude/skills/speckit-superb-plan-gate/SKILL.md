# Plan Quality Gate

> **Type:** Bridge-native after_plan gate
> **Invocation:** Mandatory post-hook for `speckit.plan` (after_plan). Executed automatically after `/speckit.plan`.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Installed Skill

Look for `writing-plans/SKILL.md` in this exact order:

1. `./.agents/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`
2. `~/.agents/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md`

If the workspace and global copies both exist, use the workspace copy.

---

## Step 1 — Check Placeholders & Plan Quality

Scan the generated `plan.md` and associated design files in the feature directory.

### Layer 1: Native writing-plans Reviewer (Preferred)

If the `writing-plans` skill was successfully resolved in Step 0 and the `define_subagent` tool is available in the assistant's tool declarations, the Controller MUST spawn a dedicated **Plan Reviewer** subagent using `define_subagent` and `invoke_subagent`:

1. **Subagent Configuration**:
    - **TypeName**: `research` or `self`
    - **Role**: `Plan Document Reviewer`
    - **Prompt**: Load and format the template from the resolved `writing-plans/plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md` file, filling in `[PLAN_FILE_PATH]` with the absolute path of `plan.md` and `[SPEC_FILE_PATH]` with the absolute path of `spec.md`.
2. **Review Execution**:
    - Invoke the subagent. The subagent will analyze the plan against the specification, completeness requirements, and the No Placeholders rules.
3. **Handle Review Result**:
    - Read the subagent's return output.
    - If the output Status is **Issues Found** or contains serious placeholder/granularity gaps:
        - **STOP** and abort the gate with Exit Code 1, listing the issues returned by the subagent.
    - If the status is **Approved**, proceed to Step 2.

### Layer 2: Local fallback discipline

If `writing-plans` is not installed or subagent tools are unavailable, the current Agent must fallback to manually scanning `plan.md` for standard placeholder patterns:

- `TODO`, `TKTK`, `???`, `<placeholder>`, and `TBD`.

If any placeholders are found in this fallback scan:

1. **STOP** and abort with a clear error:
    ```text
    ERROR: Plan contains unresolved placeholders (TODO/TKTK/???).
    All design details must be settled before proceeding.
    Found at: [file path and line context]
    ```
2. Do not proceed to task generation.

---

## Step 2 — Check Task Granularity

Analyze the tasks proposed in `plan.md` (or the initial tasks outline).

Regardless of skill availability, the Controller MUST enforce the following **Objective Redlines (FR-008)**:

- A task is strictly considered **too coarse** or **overly broad** and MUST be rejected if:
    - (a) It involves modifying **3 or more files**.
    - (b) The expected output exceeds **100 lines of production code**.

### Layer 1: Native writing-plans discipline (Preferred)

If `writing-plans` is available, additionally apply its **Bite-Sized Task Granularity** principles, ensuring each task represents a tiny, incremental change taking **2-5 minutes of focused TDD work**.

### Layer 2: Local fallback discipline

If `writing-plans` is missing, fallback to estimating that each task represents an atomic action fitting within a 2-5 minutes window.

If any task violates the FR-008 objective redlines or the 2-5 minutes window:

- **STOP** and abort with a clear error:
    ```text
    ERROR: Proposed tasks are too broad (violates 3-file/100-line granularity limits).
    Please break down the following task: [task description]
    ```
- Do not proceed to task generation.

## Step 3 — Inject Agentic SDD Directive

If all quality checks in Step 1 and Step 2 pass successfully:

1. Locate the feature's `plan.md` file.
2. Inject the mandatory directive block at the top of `plan.md` (directly below the main H1 header or description):

### Layer 1: Native writing-plans Header (Preferred)

If `writing-plans` was resolved, inject its official **Plan Document Header** directive:

```markdown
> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.
```

### Layer 2: Local fallback directive

If `writing-plans` is missing, inject the local fallback directive:

```markdown
> **For agentic workers:** Use test-driven-development and code-review to implement each task sequentially. Do not proceed to the next task until both gates pass.
```

3. Output a success message confirming the gate has passed and the directive has been successfully injected.
