# dotnet-architecture-patterns

Modern architecture patterns for .NET applications. Covers practical approaches to organizing minimal APIs at scale,
vertical slice architecture, request pipeline composition, validation strategies, caching, error handling, and
idempotency/outbox patterns.

## Scope

- Vertical slice architecture and feature-folder organization
- Request pipeline composition and MediatR patterns
- Caching strategies (memory, distributed, output caching, HybridCache)
- Error handling and problem details (RFC 9457)
- Idempotency and outbox patterns
- Result pattern for business logic error flow

## Out of scope

- DI container mechanics and async/await patterns -- see [skill:dotnet-csharp-dependency-injection] and
  [skill:dotnet-csharp-async-patterns]
- Project scaffolding and file layout -- see [skill:dotnet-scaffold-project]
- Testing strategies -- see [skill:dotnet-testing-strategy] and [skill:dotnet-integration-testing]
- SOLID principles and design pattern foundations -- see [skill:dotnet-solid-principles]

design.

idempotency, outbox), see `examples.md` in this skill directory.

## Agent Gotchas

1. **Idempotency must handle three states** -- An idempotency implementation must distinguish no-record (claim it),
   in-progress (reject duplicate), and completed (replay cached response). Check-then-act without guarding the
   in-progress state allows concurrent duplicate execution.
2. **Always finalize idempotency records unconditionally** -- Do NOT gate completion on specific `IResult` subtypes
   (e.g., `IValueHttpResult`). Non-value results like `Results.NoContent()` or `Results.Accepted()` would be left
   permanently stuck in the in-progress state.
3. **Cache invalidation must be explicit** -- When using output caching or distributed caching, ALWAYS invalidate (evict
   by tag or key) after write operations. Forgetting invalidation causes stale reads that are hard to debug.
4. **HybridCache stampede protection only works with `GetOrCreateAsync`** -- Do NOT use separate get-then-set patterns
   with `HybridCache`; use the factory overload so the library serializes concurrent requests for the same key.
5. **Outbox messages must be written in the same transaction as domain data** -- If you write the outbox message outside
   the domain transaction, a crash between the two writes loses the event. ALWAYS use `BeginTransactionAsync` to wrap
   both writes atomically.
6. **Endpoint filter order matters** -- Filters added first run outermost. A validation filter must run before an
   idempotency filter, otherwise invalid requests get cached as idempotent responses.
7. **Do NOT share `DbContext` across concurrent requests** -- `DbContext` is not thread-safe. Each request must resolve
   its own scoped instance from DI. Using a singleton or static `DbContext` causes data corruption under concurrency.

## Knowledge Sources

Architecture patterns in this skill are grounded in publicly available content from:

- **Jimmy Bogard's Vertical Slice Architecture** -- Organizing code by feature instead of by technical layer. Bogard
  advocates that each vertical slice owns its own request, handler, validation, and data access, reducing cross-feature
  coupling. He originated the popular MediatR library for request/handler dispatch in .NET, though MediatR is now
  commercial for commercial use. When applying vertical slice guidance, prefer the built-in IEndpointFilter and handler
  pattern shown above rather than introducing a third-party mediator dependency for simple scenarios. Source:
  https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/
- **Jimmy Bogard's Domain-Driven Design Patterns** -- Rich domain model guidance including entity design, value objects,
  domain events, and aggregate boundaries. Key insight: domain events should be dispatched after the aggregate state
  change is persisted (not before), to avoid inconsistency if persistence fails. Source: https://www.jimmybogard.com/
- **Nick Chapsas' Modern .NET Patterns** -- Practical patterns for modern .NET including result types for error
  handling, structured validation pipelines, and modern C# feature adoption in production codebases. Source:

> MediatR is a commercial product for commercial use; the patterns here are demonstrated with built-in .NET mechanisms.

## Code Navigation (Serena MCP)

**Primary approach:** Use Serena symbol operations for efficient code navigation:

1. **Find definitions**: `serena_find_symbol` instead of text search
2. **Understand structure**: `serena_get_symbols_overview` for file organization
3. **Track references**: `serena_find_referencing_symbols` for impact analysis
4. **Precise edits**: `serena_replace_symbol_body` for clean modifications

**When to use Serena vs traditional tools:**

- ✅ **Use Serena**: Navigation, refactoring, dependency analysis, precise edits
- ✅ **Use Read/Grep**: Reading full files, pattern matching, simple text operations
- ✅ **Fallback**: If Serena unavailable, traditional tools work fine

**Example workflow:**

```text
# Instead of:
Read: src/Services/OrderService.cs
Grep: "public void ProcessOrder"

# Use:
serena_find_symbol: "OrderService/ProcessOrder"
serena_get_symbols_overview: "src/Services/OrderService.cs"
```
